Submission for EMU PHYS380 assignment 6

potential.py should function. For some reason, pp.quiver is interpreting [x,y] as 2 lists, but not using them to form an array.
It is just using the 2 lists as raw values, generating only 10 possible locations instead of 25. I have no clue how
to fix this, so I am just submitting it as is.
